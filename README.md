# Schwarzschild

I wrote the addon system for RIFT. As part of that, I wrote a mod, to make sure that the addon system was usable to actually write stuff. This was that mod. I released it under a pseudonym so it wouldn't be connected to me - I wanted the full modder experience.

It was mildly popular, which is about what I expected.

Given how long ago that was, I figure I may as well put it here.
